PIC10C Homework 1 - Siete y Medio

Description:
Your program is expected to:
  1) play 'siete y medio' against you
  2) keep a log of the rounds you played against the dealer.
When you run your program, important information about every round should be recorded in the file "gamelog.txt".

The Card class is provided to you but is incomplete, it is missing the implementation of a couple of functions. You are to provide the interface as well as the implementation of the member functions in the Player and Hand classes. You can use as many member functions as you deem necessary and you are free to decide how to organize the fields of these two classes. The Player class should be pretty straightforward, you just need to keep track of the amount of money a player has. You should be able to initialize, access and update said amount.
